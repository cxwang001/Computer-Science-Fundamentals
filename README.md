-binarySearch.js: 
Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

-stack.js is a linear data structure. If this statement holds marginal value to you, as it originally did with me, consider this alternative: A stack organizes data into sequential order. This sequential order is commonly described as a stack of dishes at a cafeteria. When a plate is added to a stack of dishes, the plate retains the order of when it was added; moreover, when a plate is added, it is pushed towards the bottom of a stack. Every time we add a new plate, the plate is pushed towards the bottom of the stack, but it also represents the top of the stack of plates. 

-queue.js is a linear data structure. Unlike a stack, a queue deletes only the oldest added data.  To help you conceptualize how this would work, let's take a moment to use an analogy. Imagine a queue being very similar to the ticketing system of a deli. Each customer takes a ticket and is served when their number is called. The customer who takes the first ticket should be served first.
